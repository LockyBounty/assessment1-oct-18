# Number to Text

This practical test will be devoted to a very particular exercise: the conversion of a number into words. Thus, if the user enters the number "41", the script will have to return this number in full: "forty-one". Don't worry: you're perfectly capable of it, and we'll even help you a little before we give you the answers!

The procedure to follow
To complete your exercise, here are the steps your script will have to follow (you don't have to do it like that, but it's recommended):

The user is prompted to enter a number between 0 and 999.

This number must be sent to a function that converts it into words.

This same function must contain a system to separate the hundreds, tens and units. Thus, the function must be able to see that in the number 365 there are three hundred, six tens and five units. To obtain this result, remember to use the modulo. Example: 365 % 10 = 5.

Once the number has been divided into three digits, all that remains is to convert them into words.

When the function has finished executing, it returns the number in full.

Once the result of the function is obtained, it is displayed to the user.

When the display of the number in words is complete, a new number is asked again from the user.



Part 2 :

You've managed to do it in English ? Awesome! Now time to do it in French !

In the case of our exercise, we will use "French-style" number writing

we will therefore write the numbers as follows: cinq-cent-cinquante-cinq

Careful with plurals ! And do it in full french style : 95 is quatre-vingt-quinze
